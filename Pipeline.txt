1. Save Video into "/Video_Data/"
2. Save Corresponding Image Frames into a folder "Image_Data/folder_name/"
3. Run "segmentation_tracker.ipynb"
    3.a Check if number_training_images and history is set accordingly (check background image)
    3.b Check if Background Image is clean (very important)
    3.c Make sure the paths to the video and images are correct
    3.d Make sure that the array stream string has the corresponding image paths in order
    3.e Make sure the matching has been done accordingly (the shapes of the array should match the frames!!!)
4. Run "vizualization_center.ipynb"
    4.a change input parameter accordingly
    4.b check video if tracking was good enough
5. Run "save_smoothed_images.ipynb"
6. Run "particle_data_structure.ipynb"
6.5 TODO Cut radius calculator
7. Run "normal_vector_trajectory.ipynb"
8. Run "rotation_matrices_filtered.ipynb"
9. Run "roll_out.ipynb"
10. Run "visualization_clustering_ground_trajectory.ipynb" for each of the particles
