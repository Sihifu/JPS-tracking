1. learn surface of particles
2. improve clustering with categorizing and hysteresis;
    2.a calculate strong pixels (high certainty that this pixel belong to sputtered unsputtered cluster)
    2.b weak pixels will be assigned with hystersis along the gradient
3. From contour points (candidates for goiod feature points) match NCC of subsequent contours points
    3.a We need to rotate window around point accordingly (discretize 0 to 360 degrees and match on that)
    3.b Brisk method of rotating window first
4. Differences betwqeen object frames for contour
